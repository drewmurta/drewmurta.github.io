<h2>Covid in High school<h2>
<p> My senior year was a blur. I didn't attend any classes in person.<u>The whole year was virtual on zoom</u>. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy my last year at high school. The soccer season was cut short and very limited could attend the games at home or away. The football games are usually the spot =light of your senior year. Unfortunately, the board didn't allow any students to come to the games. Only parents were allowed to limit contact between people. I had good times with some of my teachers, but it didn't feel the same learning from zoom. Everyone was socially restricted. <I>I hope students never have to go through that type of experience when everything is shut down</i>. </p>
